# Why I Hate Python

This is a repo full of hatred. 

I hate Python for a lot of reasons, some of the reasons might be very biased. 
But, programming languages, as a everyday tool to programmers, inevitably they 
will be judged with personal preference, or taste, or just mood. So I'm not 
making you to be convinced by this repo that Python is ugly - Maybe you'll 
find the things I list here very attractive.

Actually, by _hate_ I mean I dislike a part of Python, but not this whole 
language - If that's true, I won't have to elaborate. I made a lot of things
with Python, it sure can get things done. Every language can't be suitable 
for every situations, but this doesn't necessarily make them bad. 

So, what's this repo for, after all? If not used to show pure hatred? I just 
want to record the things that I find dislike, or some field that Python is not
suitable for. So that if one day being asked the reasons I hate python I can 
show them this repo. Also, recording what's bad might help me to avoid them, 
then further understand the good to use python better, and to choose a right 
language for a task wisely.

编程语言对于程序员来说是一个每天都要面对的工具，所以对他们进行评判时难免掺杂个人
偏好或者品味。这个repo不在于令每个人相信Python 是一门不好的语言，或许我记录的一
些东西在你看来就是很不错的特性。

讲讨厌也是针对一部分特性，对于一个语言的评价不可能是绝对的，每个语言都有其擅长的
和不适合的领域，Python这种广受欢迎的语言，必然有其巨大的吸引力。

那么这个repo如果不是为了引起仇恨，有什么意义呢？只是想记录一下我认为不喜欢，或者
认为不适合Python的场景。如果某天被问起为什么讨厌/不使用Python，我可以拿出来这个
给他们看。另外，记录一下不好的部分，或许可以帮助避开它们，来理解好的部分，从而更
好地使用Python，或者更明智地选择编程语言。
