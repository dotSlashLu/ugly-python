# Why I hate Python

This is a repo full of hatred. 

I hate Python for a lot of reasons, some of the reasons might be very biased. 
But, programming languages, as a everyday tool to programmers, inevitably they 
will be judged with personal preference, or taste, or just mood. So I'm not 
making you to be convinced by this repo that Python is ugly - Maybe you'll 
find the things I list here very attractive.

Actually, by _hate_ I mean I dislike a part of Python, but not this whole 
language - If that's true, I won't have to elaborate. I made a lot of things
with Python, it sure can get things done. Every language can't be suitable 
for every situations, but this doesn't necessarily make them bad. 

So, what's this repo for, after all? If not used to show pure hatred? I just 
want to record the things that I find dislike, or some field that Python is not
suitable for. So that if one day being asked the reasons I hate python I can 
show them this repo. Also, recording what's bad might help me to avoid them, 
then further understand the good to use python better, and to choose a right 
language for a task wisely.
